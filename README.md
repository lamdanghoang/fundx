# FUNDX

## Introduction

- FundX is a decentralized crowdfunding platform that empowers innovative creators to raise funds from a global community of backers using secure and transparent blockchain technology.

- Built on the Sui blockchain, FundX ensures transparent fund tracking, fraud-proof accountability, and low transaction fees through verifiable smart contract execution. Campaign information such as metadata or descriptions is persistently stored using Walrus, a decentralized storage layer.

- With FundX, users can create fundraising campaigns, contribute to promising projects, and vote on milestones to decide whether funds should be released. This community-driven model revolutionizes trust and efficiency, making crowdfunding safer and more collaborative for both creators and backers.

#### FundX makes crowdfunding fair, secure, and truly decentralized.
